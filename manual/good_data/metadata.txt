Metadata

These pages are intended to test the metadata operations.

Metadata for a page (the author, date, subject, description etc) are
kept in metadata files, or metafiles. These have the same basename as
the page, with the file suffix `.meta`.

A metafile contains a metadata record, which is a text string like
this:

    # Dublin Core metadata
    DC.Title:       Webnote
    DC.Creator:     Malcolm Hutchinson
    DC.Subject:     Filesystem syntax, information systems, Django, Python
    DC.Description: Filesystem services implimenting the simple syntax.

    # END DC metadata

    # Page command options
    sort-reverse:   true
    deny:           all
    allow:          staff
    status:         draft
    # END page command


There are a number of places the metafile for a page can be found:

1.  In the parent directory.
1.  In a directory called `meta/` in the parent directory.
1.  In the paired directory.

The machine stops looking when it finds one, so a file in the parent
directory will overide files in the meta or paired directories.
