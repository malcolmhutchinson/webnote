The webnote manual
==================

This is all about how to use webnote.

We start with instructions on how to download the code from GitHub
and install it in a Django development environment.

When you first get it running, it should look into your home
directory, for a folder called `www`. If this exists, it will assume
this contains a simple syntax archive, and will display the contents
of it on the home index.

These pages also contain examples of how to structure a collection of
text files and images to form a simple syntax archive, so you can see
exactly how it works.

This is a document archive which should conform to simple syntax
rules. That is, the "good data" will conform, whereas the "bad data"
directory contains files designed to trip the machine up.

This file has several test features embedded in it too. At the moment,
this consists of a lot of exessive verbiage, the purpose of which is
merely to provide a page that is long enough such that the user will
have to scroll down to see all of it.


Level two heading
-----------------

This is the start of a main section within the page. There might be
some words along here, or maybe a figure and caption. 

### Level three heading

[[R:flowers.jpg Figure to the right.]]

This is a minor break within a section. There may well be some more
words here. Maybe even a paragraph or two.

One day soon, there will be a list of unreferenced figures, below the
contents section there. 

One day, these test files will be combined with a bunch of manual
files, and I'll ship this thing, first to my adventurer website, and
then to github or something.

It will require building a deployment script.
