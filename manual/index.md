The webnote manual
==================

This is all about how to use webnote.

We start with instructions on how to download the code from GitHub
and install it in a Django development environment.

When you first get it running, it should look into your home
directory, for a folder called `www`. If this exists, it will assume
this contains a simple syntax archive, and will display the contents
of it on the home index.

These pages also contain examples of how to structure a collection of
text files and images to form a simple syntax archive, so you can see
exactly how it works.
