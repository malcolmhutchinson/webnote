The webnote manual
==================

[[R:sydneyOperahHouse.jpg Just to show figures are working.]]


This is all about how to use webnote.

We start with instructions on how to download the code from GitHub
and install it in a Django development environment.

When you first get it running, it should look into your home
directory, for a folder called `www`. If this exists, it will assume
this contains a simple syntax archive, and will display the contents
of it on the home index.

These pages also contain examples of how to structure a collection of
text files and images to form a simple syntax archive, so you can see
exactly how it works.

This is a document archive which should conform to simple syntax
rules. That is, the "good data" will conform, whereas the "bad data"
directory contains files designed to trip the machine up.


### Index (or outline)

In a particular order.

    download and install

    configuration

        configuring the archives

        adding new archives to the server

    deployment

    using the Django app on a deployed server

        creating new pages

        editing page content and metadata

        editing files directly

    The simple syntax

        Overview

        Page relationships
        
        Pages in markdown

        Including figures with captions

That's more like an outline really. It will soon be converted into a
webnote archive of text files and illustrations in image files.
