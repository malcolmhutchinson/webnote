Good data page 1
================

    2015-11-26

TXT document with paired directory.

This page has several siblings. It also has a paired directory, with
nothing in it.

Styles testing
--------------

The line above should render as a level 2 heading. There should be
several lines of text material below it, and then we will get into
another set of headings.

There will also be code in the source file to test things like tables,
_emphasis_ (which should render as _italics_, and __strong empbasis__
which will probably appear as __bold__.

### Heading level three

Rendered above in markdown is a level three heading.

Later, this page will have links to figures, and unreferenced
figures. 

So far I've not really written styling for the headings in a main
division.

I have, however, structured the  page document to include divisions
enclosing the pocessed content from the file, and the list of
children. These can be addressed separately with css selectors.

That's a horizontal rule, and this is the last line.
