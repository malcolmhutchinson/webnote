### Webnote example pages

Welcome to the blog
===================

This is a fake blog, designed to illustrate the workings of the Simple
Syntax. It lists a set of fake blog entries, and it comes with
metadata files, and figures (which are inline visible image files). All
of these things are fake, for testing purposes.

This page is really just an index, to the blog entries, which should
be listed somewhere on this page (usually just below this paragraph).
