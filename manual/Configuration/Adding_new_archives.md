Adding new archives to the server
==================================


Yon can tell webnote about other filespaces where simple syntax
archives are kept, and add them to the list of archives displayed on
the index page.

You may have an archive called `notes` in your home directory, at
`~/notes`, and you want this to be accessible to your webnote server.
